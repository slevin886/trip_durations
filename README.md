# Route Optimization

The 'trip_retriever' script is currently running on an EC2 collecting data (duration & route) every 5 minutes of my morning and evening commutes using the Google Maps API. I plan to identify the optimal commute given an 8 hour workday and varying parameters (tolerance for route variation, flexibility for morning departure time, etc.). The script began running on November 1st, 2018. 

The jupyter notebook provides a script for the initial exploratory analysis and visualizations.
